# Project Instructions for LLM Agents

This file is part of the repository and MUST be committed to Git. Read it before inspecting or changing project files.

## Non-negotiable architecture

### Modular pages

- Every primary Flutter page must live in its own file under `lib/presentation/pages/`.
- Each page file must declare exactly one `const wristloadPage = WristloadPageModule(...)` module descriptor.
- The application shell in `lib/main.dart` must discover pages through `lib/presentation/generated_page_registry.dart`; do not add page-specific imports, navigation destinations, route branches, or switch cases directly to `main.dart`.
- After adding or removing a page file, run `tool/generate_page_registry.ps1` so the generated registry matches the files present. The Windows build helper scripts already invoke this generator before building.
- Adding a page means adding one self-contained page module file. Removing a page file must remove it from the generated registry and make the app compile without that page; the home/navigation UI must not display a removed page.
- Keep page-specific widgets, callbacks, and layout code in the page file or in narrowly scoped presentation helpers. Do not grow a monolithic `main.dart` page switch.
- Shared state and lifecycle remain in application/domain layers and are passed through `WristloadPageContext`; do not make page modules own global connection lifecycle.
- Keep module metadata (`id`, `route`, labels, icons, ordering) in the page module descriptor. Use stable unique IDs and routes.
- Generated files are not hand-edited. Change page files or the generator, then regenerate the registry.

### Platform connection separation

- macOS, Windows and Linux connection logic are separate modules. Keep macOS-specific behavior in `lib/platform/macos_v2_connection.dart`, Windows-specific behavior in `lib/platform/windows_v2_connection.dart`, and Linux-specific behavior in `lib/platform/linux_v2_connection.dart`.
- `lib/platform/desktop_v2_connection.dart` contains only the shared interface/contract and platform-neutral types. It must not contain OS-specific branching or implementation details.
- Linux RFCOMM/SPP transport lives in the local plugin `plugins/wristload_rfcomm_linux/` (BlueZ/GDBus). It exposes the same channel contract as the Android bridge (`wristload/rfcomm` + `wristload/rfcomm/events`); `lib/platform/ble_transport.dart` routes Android and Linux through the shared `_usesAndroidStyleRfcomm` path.
- Do not merge macOS and Windows pairing, identity resolution, GATT, RFCOMM/SPP setup, timeout handling, or native bridge calls into one implementation file.
- Platform selection belongs at the composition boundary (for example, the controller/factory), while each platform adapter owns its own preparation sequence. Shared authentication, SPP protocol, and connection state may remain in common domain/application code.
- A change for one operating system must not silently alter the other platform's connection flow. Preserve explicit platform-specific tests and add/update tests when changing either adapter.

## Change workflow

1. Inspect the existing module, interface, and tests before editing. Preserve unrelated user changes.
2. Keep edits narrowly scoped and use `apply_patch` for manual changes. Do not rewrite UTF-8 source files through shell redirection or encoding-ambiguous commands.
3. When changing pages, regenerate `lib/presentation/generated_page_registry.dart`.
4. Run static checks appropriate to the change, but do not run `flutter build`, `flutter test`, `flutter analyze`, packaging scripts, or launch the application unless the user explicitly requests it. The user normally performs compilation and testing.
5. Report changed files, static checks performed, and any remaining limitation.

## UI Copy Discipline

- UI text must represent a real user-facing state, data value, error, warning, or executable action. Do not add explanatory, promotional, instructional, or feature-introduction copy merely to describe how an interface works.
- Do not add meaningless metadata, decorative labels, duplicated status, or implementation terms that do not help the user complete the current task.
- Prefer clear labels such as device names, connection state, current target, and action names. Express behavior through layout, state, and interaction rather than sentences such as "this action only affects the current device".
- Apply this rule to all newly created or edited Flutter UI, HTML demonstrations, dialogs, settings, and tooltips. Existing copy may be changed only when it is in the scope of the requested UI work.

## Repository boundaries

- `lib/application/`: application orchestration and lifecycle.
- `lib/domain/`: protocol, persistence, and device business logic.
- `lib/platform/`: OS adapters and native transport integration.
- `lib/presentation/`: Flutter UI, dialogs, shared widgets, and page modules.
- `plugins/`: locally overridden third-party/native plugins; preserve their platform APIs and behavior unless the task explicitly targets them.
- `tui/`: separate terminal UI package; do not couple Flutter page modules to TUI internals.

## Safety

- Never use `git reset --hard`, `git checkout --`, `git clean`, or broad destructive deletion.
- Never discard existing user modifications or stash entries.
- Do not commit secrets, authkeys, logs containing credentials, or generated build artifacts.

## TUI Design System

For any task involving TUI visual design, layout, interaction, responsive behavior, device list rendering, connection status presentation, installation views, logs, mouse input, keyboard navigation, terminal resize handling, theme design, or frontend usability, **MUST use `$tui-design-system`**.

The TUI frontend must follow the visual and interaction rules defined by `$tui-design-system`.

The intended design direction is:

`OpenCode-inspired visual language + lazygit-style information organization + Wristload-specific connection inspector`.

The frontend rewrite must remain frontend-only. Do not modify the already-working TUI backend, Bluetooth transport, Xiaomi protocol, authentication/session logic, or native macOS communication code merely to satisfy visual requirements.

The primary TUI layout should prioritize:

`Header / Global Status → Device Browser + Device Inspector → Activity → Command Bar`

The selected device inspector should expose the actual connection pipeline when backend state is available, including states such as:

`Identity → Pairing → SDP → RFCOMM → L1 → f=26 → f=27 → Session`

Do not reduce connection status to a generic `Connected` label when richer verified backend state exists.

The TUI must use a centralized black-blue default theme, restrained borders, compact spacing, high information density, clear selection/focus states, mouse and keyboard support, and responsive layouts.

The device list must preserve complete device-name accessibility. Do not blindly truncate names using fixed-width columns. When terminal width becomes limited, first reduce optional spacing/metadata, then wrap or switch to stacked layouts, and truncate only as a final fallback.

Mouse and keyboard must share the same authoritative selection/focus model. `Enter` must trigger the primary action for the current context; for a selected disconnected device, the primary action is connection, not viewing details.

Authkey input must be explicitly tied to the pending/selected device and must not silently retarget when selection changes.

The main TUI should contain only a compact recent-activity view. Full diagnostic logs must be available through a dedicated shortcut and separate log viewer/window where supported, without affecting the main TUI or Bluetooth connection lifecycle.

Installation should have a dedicated progress/state view rather than only a percentage.

The frontend must consume backend state and must never invent transport, authentication, readiness, or installation success.

When frontend work exposes a backend, Bluetooth, protocol, TCC, or APK-analysis issue, invoke the appropriate existing Skill instead of silently changing backend behavior from the UI layer.

Before declaring the TUI frontend complete, verify at minimum:

`wide terminal → medium terminal → narrow terminal → runtime resize → mouse selection → keyboard selection → Enter primary action → authkey input → saved-device display → connected/failed states → installation view → activity panel → separate log viewer → clean exit`
